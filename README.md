## How to use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Train and test the PRM with the given data or other datasets.

```
python test_reading_model.py ../data ../data -m MER-VPT-V3 -o ../output/lognormal --ignore_no_clicks --ignore_no_viewport --viewport_time -V 8
```
  - ``-m``: The model that you would like to run.
  - ``-o``: The path to output dictionary.
  - ``-V``: The viewport time model used in PRM: 
    - ``8``: PRM with log-normal
    - ``9``: PRM with gamma
    - ``10``: PRM with Weibull 

3. Run ``evaluate_reading_model.py`` to evaluate the PRM on passage ranking and document-level relevance estimation tasks.
